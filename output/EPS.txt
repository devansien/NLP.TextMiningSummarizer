NOTE: (a) Shares for three and six months ended July 31, 1995 presented on a pro forma basis using conversion factor of 7.12 for each historical share outstanding.Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd is expected to report on Thursday a stagnant net profit for the year to June 30, held back by soaring newsprint costs and losses from its burgeoning Star TV operations, analysts said.
The median forecast in BZW's BARCEPS broker survey is for a A$1.343 billion net profit before abnormals for the year, a virtual replica of the A$1.342 billion profit posted in 1994/95.
Analysts said News may even struggle to match last year's result, particularly given its lower than expected third quarter result.  
"It's got to be a reasonably strong last quarter to match that (1994/95) figure," said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett media analyst John Bell.
"I doubt there'll be many surprises on the upside," he said.
News posted a A$281 million net profit before abnormals in the third quarter, below expectations of about A$300 million and taking profits for the first nine months of the year to A$944 million.
The result is expected around 8.30 a.m. Australian time on Thursday (2230 GMT Wednesday).  
Analysts said News' 1995/96 profits had been restrained generally by the higher paper costs, a U.K. cover price war and continued losses from its Star TV operation in Hong Kong.
"People will look at newspapers because that will reflect higher newsprint prices and the impact of the newspaper price war," said one Melbourne media analyst.
Margins on News' British newspapers were seen pressured in the final few months of the year by cover price discounts ahead of the Olympics.
"There was a little bit of renewed competition on the Monday cover prices pre-Olympics," Bell said.  
"Margins may have slipped a little bit in the last few months of the year," he said.
Star TV was seen pumping out another US$90 million to US$100 million of losses for the year as it establishes itself in the potentially lucrative Asian satellite television markets.
"I would expect a full year loss of US$90 million given what we've been told so far and I've seen nothing to change that," the Melbourne analyst said.
"I would see it somewhere in excess of of US$100 million," Bell said.  
Continued strong earnings from U.S. television and films are seen offsetting somewhat the newsprint and Star TV losses.
Looking ahead however, analysts are confident News' profits can start growing again in 1996/97, boosted by potentially lower newsprint prices and an earnings surge from the hit U.S. special effects movie, "Independence Day".
"'Independence Day' could add up to US$200 million to the bottom line," said Bell, who forecast net profit rising to A$1.5 billion in 1996/97.  
"The 1996/97 result will show some clear profit growth as much as anything because of paper prices and 'Independence Day'," the Melbourne analyst said, who forecast a A$1.6 billion net profit.
News' share price was down one cent at A$6.49 at 2.00 p.m. (0400 GMT).
-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800Philippines' Asiatrust Bank has set a price of 39.88 pesos per share for its initial public offering due to open on September 3, the issue's international lead manager PrimeEast Capital (HongKong) Ltd said.
The bank is offering 18.8 million shares, or a 27.1 percent public float and hopes to raise 750 million pesos. The offer closes September 16 and listing is set for October 7.
PrimeEast said money from the IPO would be used to fund the bank's loan portfolio expansion, for information technology upgrade as well as for opening of new branches.
"The issue is very attractive at a PER of 11 times prospective 1997 earnings on an expected EPS growth of 70 percent," PrimeEast's research head for the Philippines, Joy Quintos, said in a statement.
"This is a big discount to the average sector PER of 16.5 times for 1997, with an estimated average EPS growth of 31 percent," Quintos said.
Asiatrust's net earnings have grown by a compounded annual rate of 32 percent in the last five years and this is expected to grow by 70 percent and 31 percent in 1996 and 1997, the statement said. PrimeEast said a roadshow was planned in Hong Kong and Singapore later this month.Year to December 31, 1996

IMI's forecast for 1996 earnings per share (EPS) is based on the firm's current 6.06 million shares outstanding against 571,000 shares as of December 31, 1995, it said.
The dramatic increase in the number of IMI shares is mainly due to a share split the company carried out on May 1.

    Otra		Wholesaler     31.50  ING Barings  
COMMENT: Hold (from Sell) Otra's profit warning last week
that net results in H1 1996 will be substantially (30-45 pct)
below H1 1995, came as a surprise. Although estimates have been
downgraded and a 38.5 pct decline of net profits to 24.5 mln
guilders could be expected, it is worth raising the stock from
sell to hold as the share price dropped 25 pct since the profit
warning. Current share price incorporates all the bad news and
downside risk is limited.

-- Amsterdam newsroom, +31 20 504 5000 (Fax +31 20 504 5040)-- Cowen & Co analyst James Kedersha said he raised his 1996 and 1997 earnings per share view on Newbridge Networks Corp after the company reported solid first quarter results.
He said he raised his 1997 EPS estimate by $0.10 to $2.25 and his 1998 EPS view by $0.15 to $2.85.
"There has been a lot of controversy about Newbridge over the past quarter and a number of analysts have either downgraded the stock or cast serious doubts on its ability to make the quarter," Kedersha said.
"It turns out that they didn't just make the quarter but they beat it," he said, adding that orders were strong and the company had a positive balance sheet. "Everything you could want was there."
-- Shares of Newbridge were up 6-5/8 at 55 on the NYSE.The following bond increase was announced by lead manager Kredietbank.

COMMENT: Buy (unchanged)
Pakhoed's H1 results from normal operations somewhat better than expected. Cost cutting programs, divestments and investments and a clear strategy could pave the way for better returns in coming two to three years. Company has taken major steps to focus on tank storage and distribution/shipping of chemicals. Based on positive developments and EPS upside of 7.00 guilders by 1999 we maintain our Buy recommendation.

    Vendex	    retail	   59.80  ING Barings
COMMENT: Buy (from Hold). Following positive Dutch retail sales figures for the first six months of 1996, we expect a spectacular turnaround at Vendex Food and moderate increase in both sales and results at Vroom & Dreesmann department stores and the firm's speciality stores. Also sustained growth in temporary services. The share buy-back of 4 million common stock should give inspiration. 1996 and 1997 EPS estimates raised.

-- Amsterdam newsroom, +31 20 504 5000 (Fax +31 20 504 5040)Lower than expected first half profits at Swiss banking group CS Holding underscore the urgency of huge restructuring plans announced by the conglomerate in July, analysts said.
Analysts said net profit for the first six months, which increased 20 percent after minority interests, was below most expectations. Costs grew more strongly than widely forecast.
But several analysts also said the quality of CS profits was increasing and added that the group had greater potential than rivals Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) or Swiss Bank Corp (SBC) because it was restructuring later.  
Market forecasts of net profit had ranged between 879 million and 1.104 billion Swiss francs, compared to the group's 830 million after minority interests.
"The difference between CS Holding and the other two big banks underscores the need for restructuring," said banking analyst Thomas Bieri at Zurich Cantonal Bank.
"I have the impression that costs are relatively high at CS Holding than at the others," he told Reuters.
CS Holding's total operating expenses rose 17 percent, which it said was mainly due to incentive bonuses paid to staff.  
John Leonard from Salomon Bros in London said he was puzzled that staff bonuses had risen so strongly.
CS Holding said incentive pay comprised 400 million Swiss francs of an overall increase in staff costs of 498 million, or 21 percent, to 2.86 billion Swiss francs.
"I know incentive payments increase generally as revenues grow. But it was a real source of suprise that the accruals for incentive compensation rose so strongly," he said.
"Total costs were a couple of hundred million (Swiss francs) more than I expected," Leonard added.  
Leonard said the cost ratio at CS Holding was 67.4 percent including depreciation, as against 69 percent a year earlier.
By comparison, SBC had a cost ratio with depreciation of 68.4 percent in the first half of this year and UBS posted 61.5.
Thomas Kalbermatten from UBS Global Research, who had forecast net profit growth higher at 28 percent, said it was positive that commission income now made up 38 percent of all earnings from 36 percent in the same period last year.
"The quality of profits is improving in a way that has become general in the banking sector," he said.
"Compared to other Swiss banks, CS Holding has the greatest potential because it is just starting on reorganisation," he said.
Kalbermatten said potential costs savings and earnings growth had alrady been tapped at least in part by CS's rivals.
UBS has spent several years streamlining its activities and SBC, which last year integrated investment banking arm SBC Warburg, in May announced a reorganisation along four core business lines.
Kalbermattern said he would maintain his estimates for CS Holding 1996 full-year net profit of 1.6 billion or 8.50 Swiss francs earnings per share and for 1997 of 2.07 billion or 10.90 per share. He maintains CS and SBC as buy ratings.
Salomon's Leonard said he would likely lower his EPS estimates from 8.96 Swiss francs this year and 10.40 in 1997. CS Holding would remain a hold alongside SBC and UBS, with SBC favoured.
Bieri at Zurich Cantonal Bank also said he would lower his 1996 full-year forecast for CS Holding from net profit of 1.619 billion and an EPS of 8.40.
Bieri said he would likley downgrade CS Holding from buy to hold. UBS is a hold and SBC a buy in his ratings.

- Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211Norwegian energy group Hafslund ASA on Wednesday attributed a 28 percent decline in first half operating profits to low water levels for hydropower production.
Hafslund's production fell 19 percent in the six month period to 985 gigawatt hours (GWh) compared with 1,211 GWh a year ago.
Operating profit amounted to 103 million crowns against 143 million crowns in the first half of 1995. Pre-tax profits slipped 30 million crowns to 150 million crowns.
"The decline in operating profit is caused by substantially lower water level in the Glomma River in the first six months of 1996 compared with last year," Hafslund said in a statement.
Norwegian power production has fallen in the first half of the year due to a shortfall of rain and snowfall last winter, which has resulted in low water levels in the country's reservoirs for hydroelectric production.
Hafslund said electricity prices in the spot market were stable and high due to the low precipitation. Avergae spot level for the period to June 30 was 0.238 crowns per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared with 0.128 kWh last year.
The group posted earnings per share (EPS) for the first half of 1.12 crowns.

NOTE - Swedish gas company AGA was expected to post a profit after financial items of 1.09 billion crowns for the first half, according to a Reuters poll of 10 analyasts.
-- Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1017The research arm of Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, on Thursday said it had lowered its EPS forecasts for the German chemical company Merck KGaA for 1996, 1997 and 1998.  
For 1996 Deutsche MG has downgraded Merck's EPS forecast to 2.27 marks from 2.47 marks, for 1997 to 2.57 marks from 2.87 marks and for 1998 to 3.09 marks from 3.50 marks.
Deutsche MG analysts said the downgrade came in the wake of an analysts' conference call after Merck reported its first-half figures for 1996.
The analysts said they believed Merck would not achieve its forecast profit increase of 30 to 40 percent for the full year and downgraded the share as a result.
Rumours of a downgrade put Merck shares under pressure in early pre-bourse trade. At 0817 GMT Merck shares led the losers on the IBIS DAX index, down 1.10 marks or 1.92 percent at 56.20 marks, compared to the overall market, up 0.31 percent.

--New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610.Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C.L. Lawrence (corrects from J.C. Bradford) initiated coverage of six semiconductor related companies with accumulate and hold ratings.
Analyst Kathryn Buergert said she started Brooks Automation Inc and Tencor Instruments with accumulate and Electroglas Inc with hold.
She said the rating were based on the companies' earnings per share outlook. Brooks EPS are expected to climb to $1.15 in fiscal year 1997 from $1.07 in 1996. Tencor is expected to climb to $1.70 from $1.13 while Electroglas is expected to fall to $0.85 from $1.63.  
Analyst Elliott Rogers said he initiated coverage of DuPont Photomasks Inc and Semitool Inc with accumulate and LTX Corp with hold.
"The accumulate ratings reflect some uncertainty about the near-term outlook as far as capital spending is concerned," Rogers said.
"The hold rating on LTX reflects these same concerns but exacerbated by a customer -- Korea's Daewoo Corp -- which claims an order worth $50 million was never placed."Analysts responded positively on Thursday to the announcement by Hungary's State Privatisation Agency APV that Danubius Hotels had won the tender to buy 85 percent of hotel chain Hungaria Szalloda.
"We're certainly pleased that they've bought it," said Frances Cloud of Nomura Equity Research in London. "It can add quite a lot of value to their portfolio and the price was quite reasonable." @
APV announced earlier on Thursday that Danubius would pay 8.125 billion forints for the stake, representing 173.8 percent of the face value of the shares.
The remaining 15 percent stake will be offered to employees with Danubius obliged to buy any shares not subscribed at the same rate of 173.8 percent of face value.
The agreement will take effect as soon as the government's Competition Agency has given its approval.
Cloud believes the deal will have no trouble getting past the Competition Agency despite a clause in the tender limiting the winner to 30 percent of the domestic hotel market. @
The combined market share of Danubius and Hungarhotels is around 27 percent in all categories of hotel but rises to above 30 percent if the Beta Hotel chain in which Danubius has shares is included.
However sources within Danubius have said that as the company does not actually control or manage Beta it would be left out of the equation.
"They will have thought about this in advance and I am sure they have worked out plans to get round this," Cloud said, adding that it was unlikely the deal would have been approved by the APV if there was a danger of rejection by the agency. @
Anthony Vago of Bank Austria Giro Credit in Hungary also welcomed the deal but warned that the means by which Danubius pays for the acquisition could make a difference in terms of earnings per share (EPS).
These would increase if funds are generated through an equity raise but could fall if the company uses debt.
"EPS is going to go down if it's financed with debt but that's offset with the profits it gets from the group," he said. @
"But I think it would be wise for them to finance it with a capital increase. That would be the logical way to go." he said, adding that neither scenario would affect long-term propects for the Danubius shares, which he rates as a long-term buy.
Cloud believes there could be a combination of different modes of payment.
"I don't think they quite know yet how they're going to do it," she said. "There could be a combination of debt and a capital increase or they may be allowed to pay in instalments," she said. @
Hungaria Szalloda, which as HungarHotels was the subject of a failed bid by American General Hospitality Corp of Dallas, Texas, early last year, is made up of 14 mainly provincial hotels.
In January, the APV hived off the HungarHotels' flagship hotel, the Budapest Forum, for a separate tender and in May announced a new tender for an 85 percent stake in the 14 remaining hotels under the Hungaria Szalloda name.
The APV said it had not yet reached a decision on the Hotel Forum tender. @
The Budapest Stock Exchange earlier suspended trading in Danubius shares on the strength of newspaper reports anticipating the announcement of the sale. Trading of the papers will resume on Friday.
-- Duncan Shiels, Budapest newsroom +361 266 2410-- Morgan Stanley analyst David Togut said he reduced the earnings estimates for First Data Corp, citing the company becoming "modestly more conservative" on near-term and intermediate-term earnings growth potential.
-- also cited lower-than-expected growth at its Western Union international business; further delays in Act III, its healthcare claims processing system; slower-than-expected sales at its First Image business; and tighter lending stadnards from credit-card issuers.
-- Togut said managers remain confident of a 20 percent EPS growth target.
-- reduced his earnings estimate to $2.72 per share from $2.75 for 1996, and to $3.25 from $3.35 for 1997.

NOTE: (a) Shares for three and six months ended July 31, 1995 presented on a pro forma basis using conversion factor of 7.12 for each historical share outstanding.Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd is expected to report on Thursday a stagnant net profit for the year to June 30, held back by soaring newsprint costs and losses from its burgeoning Star TV operations, analysts said.
The median forecast in BZW's BARCEPS broker survey is for a A$1.343 billion net profit before abnormals for the year, a virtual replica of the A$1.342 billion profit posted in 1994/95.
Analysts said News may even struggle to match last year's result, particularly given its lower than expected third quarter result.  
"It's got to be a reasonably strong last quarter to match that (1994/95) figure," said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett media analyst John Bell.
"I doubt there'll be many surprises on the upside," he said.
News posted a A$281 million net profit before abnormals in the third quarter, below expectations of about A$300 million and taking profits for the first nine months of the year to A$944 million.
The result is expected around 8.30 a.m. Australian time on Thursday (2230 GMT Wednesday).  
Analysts said News' 1995/96 profits had been restrained generally by the higher paper costs, a U.K. cover price war and continued losses from its Star TV operation in Hong Kong.
"People will look at newspapers because that will reflect higher newsprint prices and the impact of the newspaper price war," said one Melbourne media analyst.
Margins on News' British newspapers were seen pressured in the final few months of the year by cover price discounts ahead of the Olympics.
"There was a little bit of renewed competition on the Monday cover prices pre-Olympics," Bell said.  
"Margins may have slipped a little bit in the last few months of the year," he said.
Star TV was seen pumping out another US$90 million to US$100 million of losses for the year as it establishes itself in the potentially lucrative Asian satellite television markets.
"I would expect a full year loss of US$90 million given what we've been told so far and I've seen nothing to change that," the Melbourne analyst said.
"I would see it somewhere in excess of of US$100 million," Bell said.  
Continued strong earnings from U.S. television and films are seen offsetting somewhat the newsprint and Star TV losses.
Looking ahead however, analysts are confident News' profits can start growing again in 1996/97, boosted by potentially lower newsprint prices and an earnings surge from the hit U.S. special effects movie, "Independence Day".
"'Independence Day' could add up to US$200 million to the bottom line," said Bell, who forecast net profit rising to A$1.5 billion in 1996/97.  
"The 1996/97 result will show some clear profit growth as much as anything because of paper prices and 'Independence Day'," the Melbourne analyst said, who forecast a A$1.6 billion net profit.
News' share price was down one cent at A$6.49 at 2.00 p.m. (0400 GMT).
-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800Philippines' Asiatrust Bank has set a price of 39.88 pesos per share for its initial public offering due to open on September 3, the issue's international lead manager PrimeEast Capital (HongKong) Ltd said.
The bank is offering 18.8 million shares, or a 27.1 percent public float and hopes to raise 750 million pesos. The offer closes September 16 and listing is set for October 7.
PrimeEast said money from the IPO would be used to fund the bank's loan portfolio expansion, for information technology upgrade as well as for opening of new branches.
"The issue is very attractive at a PER of 11 times prospective 1997 earnings on an expected EPS growth of 70 percent," PrimeEast's research head for the Philippines, Joy Quintos, said in a statement.
"This is a big discount to the average sector PER of 16.5 times for 1997, with an estimated average EPS growth of 31 percent," Quintos said.
Asiatrust's net earnings have grown by a compounded annual rate of 32 percent in the last five years and this is expected to grow by 70 percent and 31 percent in 1996 and 1997, the statement said. PrimeEast said a roadshow was planned in Hong Kong and Singapore later this month.Year to December 31, 1996

    Otra		Wholesaler     31.50  ING Barings  
COMMENT: Hold (from Sell) Otra's profit warning last week
that net results in H1 1996 will be substantially (30-45 pct)
below H1 1995, came as a surprise. Although estimates have been
downgraded and a 38.5 pct decline of net profits to 24.5 mln
guilders could be expected, it is worth raising the stock from
sell to hold as the share price dropped 25 pct since the profit
warning. Current share price incorporates all the bad news and
downside risk is limited.

-- Amsterdam newsroom, +31 20 504 5000 (Fax +31 20 504 5040)-- Cowen & Co analyst James Kedersha said he raised his 1996 and 1997 earnings per share view on Newbridge Networks Corp after the company reported solid first quarter results.
He said he raised his 1997 EPS estimate by $0.10 to $2.25 and his 1998 EPS view by $0.15 to $2.85.
"There has been a lot of controversy about Newbridge over the past quarter and a number of analysts have either downgraded the stock or cast serious doubts on its ability to make the quarter," Kedersha said.
"It turns out that they didn't just make the quarter but they beat it," he said, adding that orders were strong and the company had a positive balance sheet. "Everything you could want was there."
-- Shares of Newbridge were up 6-5/8 at 55 on the NYSE.The following bond increase was announced by lead manager Kredietbank.

    Pakhoed    transport/storage   45.90	   ING Barings
COMMENT: Buy (unchanged)
Pakhoed's H1 results from normal operations somewhat better than expected. Cost cutting programs, divestments and investments and a clear strategy could pave the way for better returns in coming two to three years. Company has taken major steps to focus on tank storage and distribution/shipping of chemicals. Based on positive developments and EPS upside of 7.00 guilders by 1999 we maintain our Buy recommendation.

    Vendex	    retail	   59.80  ING Barings
COMMENT: Buy (from Hold). Following positive Dutch retail sales figures for the first six months of 1996, we expect a spectacular turnaround at Vendex Food and moderate increase in both sales and results at Vroom & Dreesmann department stores and the firm's speciality stores. Also sustained growth in temporary services. The share buy-back of 4 million common stock should give inspiration. 1996 and 1997 EPS estimates raised.

-- Amsterdam newsroom, +31 20 504 5000 (Fax +31 20 504 5040)Lower than expected first half profits at Swiss banking group CS Holding underscore the urgency of huge restructuring plans announced by the conglomerate in July, analysts said.
Analysts said net profit for the first six months, which increased 20 percent after minority interests, was below most expectations. Costs grew more strongly than widely forecast.
But several analysts also said the quality of CS profits was increasing and added that the group had greater potential than rivals Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) or Swiss Bank Corp (SBC) because it was restructuring later.  
Market forecasts of net profit had ranged between 879 million and 1.104 billion Swiss francs, compared to the group's 830 million after minority interests.
"The difference between CS Holding and the other two big banks underscores the need for restructuring," said banking analyst Thomas Bieri at Zurich Cantonal Bank.
"I have the impression that costs are relatively high at CS Holding than at the others," he told Reuters.
CS Holding's total operating expenses rose 17 percent, which it said was mainly due to incentive bonuses paid to staff.  
John Leonard from Salomon Bros in London said he was puzzled that staff bonuses had risen so strongly.
CS Holding said incentive pay comprised 400 million Swiss francs of an overall increase in staff costs of 498 million, or 21 percent, to 2.86 billion Swiss francs.
"I know incentive payments increase generally as revenues grow. But it was a real source of suprise that the accruals for incentive compensation rose so strongly," he said.
"Total costs were a couple of hundred million (Swiss francs) more than I expected," Leonard added.  
Leonard said the cost ratio at CS Holding was 67.4 percent including depreciation, as against 69 percent a year earlier.
By comparison, SBC had a cost ratio with depreciation of 68.4 percent in the first half of this year and UBS posted 61.5.
Thomas Kalbermatten from UBS Global Research, who had forecast net profit growth higher at 28 percent, said it was positive that commission income now made up 38 percent of all earnings from 36 percent in the same period last year.
"The quality of profits is improving in a way that has become general in the banking sector," he said.
"Compared to other Swiss banks, CS Holding has the greatest potential because it is just starting on reorganisation," he said.
Kalbermatten said potential costs savings and earnings growth had alrady been tapped at least in part by CS's rivals.
UBS has spent several years streamlining its activities and SBC, which last year integrated investment banking arm SBC Warburg, in May announced a reorganisation along four core business lines.
Kalbermattern said he would maintain his estimates for CS Holding 1996 full-year net profit of 1.6 billion or 8.50 Swiss francs earnings per share and for 1997 of 2.07 billion or 10.90 per share. He maintains CS and SBC as buy ratings.
Salomon's Leonard said he would likely lower his EPS estimates from 8.96 Swiss francs this year and 10.40 in 1997. CS Holding would remain a hold alongside SBC and UBS, with SBC favoured.
Bieri at Zurich Cantonal Bank also said he would lower his 1996 full-year forecast for CS Holding from net profit of 1.619 billion and an EPS of 8.40.
Bieri said he would likley downgrade CS Holding from buy to hold. UBS is a hold and SBC a buy in his ratings.

- Tel Aviv newsroom, 972-3-537-2211Norwegian energy group Hafslund ASA on Wednesday attributed a 28 percent decline in first half operating profits to low water levels for hydropower production.
Hafslund's production fell 19 percent in the six month period to 985 gigawatt hours (GWh) compared with 1,211 GWh a year ago.
Operating profit amounted to 103 million crowns against 143 million crowns in the first half of 1995. Pre-tax profits slipped 30 million crowns to 150 million crowns.
"The decline in operating profit is caused by substantially lower water level in the Glomma River in the first six months of 1996 compared with last year," Hafslund said in a statement.
Norwegian power production has fallen in the first half of the year due to a shortfall of rain and snowfall last winter, which has resulted in low water levels in the country's reservoirs for hydroelectric production.
Hafslund said electricity prices in the spot market were stable and high due to the low precipitation. Avergae spot level for the period to June 30 was 0.238 crowns per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared with 0.128 kWh last year.
The group posted earnings per share (EPS) for the first half of 1.12 crowns.

NOTE - Swedish gas company AGA was expected to post a profit after financial items of 1.09 billion crowns for the first half, according to a Reuters poll of 10 analyasts.
-- Stockholm newsroom +46-8-700 1017The research arm of Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, on Thursday said it had lowered its EPS forecasts for the German chemical company Merck KGaA for 1996, 1997 and 1998.  
For 1996 Deutsche MG has downgraded Merck's EPS forecast to 2.27 marks from 2.47 marks, for 1997 to 2.57 marks from 2.87 marks and for 1998 to 3.09 marks from 3.50 marks.
Deutsche MG analysts said the downgrade came in the wake of an analysts' conference call after Merck reported its first-half figures for 1996.
The analysts said they believed Merck would not achieve its forecast profit increase of 30 to 40 percent for the full year and downgraded the share as a result.
Rumours of a downgrade put Merck shares under pressure in early pre-bourse trade. At 0817 GMT Merck shares led the losers on the IBIS DAX index, down 1.10 marks or 1.92 percent at 56.20 marks, compared to the overall market, up 0.31 percent.

--New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610.Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C.L. Lawrence (corrects from J.C. Bradford) initiated coverage of six semiconductor related companies with accumulate and hold ratings.
Analyst Kathryn Buergert said she started Brooks Automation Inc and Tencor Instruments with accumulate and Electroglas Inc with hold.
She said the rating were based on the companies' earnings per share outlook. Brooks EPS are expected to climb to $1.15 in fiscal year 1997 from $1.07 in 1996. Tencor is expected to climb to $1.70 from $1.13 while Electroglas is expected to fall to $0.85 from $1.63.  
Analyst Elliott Rogers said he initiated coverage of DuPont Photomasks Inc and Semitool Inc with accumulate and LTX Corp with hold.
"The accumulate ratings reflect some uncertainty about the near-term outlook as far as capital spending is concerned," Rogers said.
"The hold rating on LTX reflects these same concerns but exacerbated by a customer -- Korea's Daewoo Corp -- which claims an order worth $50 million was never placed."Analysts responded positively on Thursday to the announcement by Hungary's State Privatisation Agency APV that Danubius Hotels had won the tender to buy 85 percent of hotel chain Hungaria Szalloda.
"We're certainly pleased that they've bought it," said Frances Cloud of Nomura Equity Research in London. "It can add quite a lot of value to their portfolio and the price was quite reasonable." @
APV announced earlier on Thursday that Danubius would pay 8.125 billion forints for the stake, representing 173.8 percent of the face value of the shares.
The remaining 15 percent stake will be offered to employees with Danubius obliged to buy any shares not subscribed at the same rate of 173.8 percent of face value.
The agreement will take effect as soon as the government's Competition Agency has given its approval.
Cloud believes the deal will have no trouble getting past the Competition Agency despite a clause in the tender limiting the winner to 30 percent of the domestic hotel market. @
The combined market share of Danubius and Hungarhotels is around 27 percent in all categories of hotel but rises to above 30 percent if the Beta Hotel chain in which Danubius has shares is included.
However sources within Danubius have said that as the company does not actually control or manage Beta it would be left out of the equation.
"They will have thought about this in advance and I am sure they have worked out plans to get round this," Cloud said, adding that it was unlikely the deal would have been approved by the APV if there was a danger of rejection by the agency. @
Anthony Vago of Bank Austria Giro Credit in Hungary also welcomed the deal but warned that the means by which Danubius pays for the acquisition could make a difference in terms of earnings per share (EPS).
These would increase if funds are generated through an equity raise but could fall if the company uses debt.
"EPS is going to go down if it's financed with debt but that's offset with the profits it gets from the group," he said. @
"But I think it would be wise for them to finance it with a capital increase. That would be the logical way to go." he said, adding that neither scenario would affect long-term propects for the Danubius shares, which he rates as a long-term buy.
Cloud believes there could be a combination of different modes of payment.
"I don't think they quite know yet how they're going to do it," she said. "There could be a combination of debt and a capital increase or they may be allowed to pay in instalments," she said. @
Hungaria Szalloda, which as HungarHotels was the subject of a failed bid by American General Hospitality Corp of Dallas, Texas, early last year, is made up of 14 mainly provincial hotels.
In January, the APV hived off the HungarHotels' flagship hotel, the Budapest Forum, for a separate tender and in May announced a new tender for an 85 percent stake in the 14 remaining hotels under the Hungaria Szalloda name.
The APV said it had not yet reached a decision on the Hotel Forum tender. @
The Budapest Stock Exchange earlier suspended trading in Danubius shares on the strength of newspaper reports anticipating the announcement of the sale. Trading of the papers will resume on Friday.
