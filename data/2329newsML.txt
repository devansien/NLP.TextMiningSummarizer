Snap-on Inc. said Tuesday its Snap-on Tools Co. unit will provide car care and maintenance equipment for more than 800 Penske Auto Centres Inc., which are located in Kmart Corp. stores across the country.
The value of the deal was not disclosed.
Last October, Penske acquired Kmart's automotive service centres for $112 million. The nation's second-largest retailer subleased the space of the auto centres to Penske, which is owned by the transporation magnate Roger Penske.
